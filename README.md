# What's this project about?
This project is a small project which I will be working on during my "learning days" at work. This project will allow me to explore topics that I have not covered yet in my work environment, which I think will be useful skills to learn.

# What will I be working on?
This project will be focusing on creating a "shop" application. This application will allow users to create an account, login, view products, add products to their cart, and checkout. This project will be made primarily using Wagtail. Complete tech-stack TBC.

This will allow me to expand my knowledge on things like Docker, Wagtail, and other technologies that I may have not used before.
